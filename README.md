# Accordion Unlock System (React)

An interactive Accordion component built using React.js that features a progressive unlock system — where each topic unlocks one after another as the user explores the content.

# Features

- Progressive Unlocking System – Only unlocked topics can be opened; next topic unlocks after completing the current one.

- Expandable & Collapsible Topics – Click on a topic to view its details.

- Dynamic State Handling – Uses React hooks (useState) for managing open and unlocked states.

- Clean UI Design – Simple, structured, and responsive layout.

- React Icons Integration – Uses icons like FiLock, FiUnlock, FiChevronDown, and FiChevronUp for visual clarity.

## How It Works

1. Initially, only the first topic is unlocked.

2. When you open it and click “Unlock Next Topic”, the next accordion section becomes accessible.

3. Locked topics show a 🔒 lock icon and cannot be opened until unlocked.
